# APD-Proj
The purpose of the project is to test the performance of serial implementation of Merge Sort versus the parallel implementation. <br/>
The project is written in Python. <br/>
For the parallel implementation, mpi4py will be used. <br/>

The implementation of the serial algorithm is fount in algo.py. <br/>
The main driver for testing the code is found in driver.py. <br/>
The code used for data generation is found in dataGenerator.py. <br/>

Results can be found in result.txt. The time elapsed is exprimated in seconds. <br/>

The machine used for running the tests:
* OS Windows 11
* CPU Intel i5-10300H 2.5ghz, 4cores, 8 logical cores
* RAM 16GB
