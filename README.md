# APD-Proj
The purpose of the project is to test the performance of serial implementation of Merge Sort versus the parallel implementation.
The project is written in Python.
For the parallel implementation, mpi4py.

The implementation of the serial algorithm is fount in algo.py.
The main driver for testing the code is found in driver.py.
The code used for data generation is found in dataGenerator.py.

The machine used for running the tests:
* OS Windows 11
* CPU Intel i5-10300H 2.5ghz, 4cores, 8 logical cores
* RAM 16GB
